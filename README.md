# B-Spline-Curve-Plotter

This MATLAB script generates and plots a B-spline curve based on user-defined control points and degree. The control points are customizable, and the curve is calculated using recursive B-spline basis functions.

## How to Run

1. Define the control points and degree of the B-spline in the script.
2. Run the script to compute and plot the B-spline curve.

### Example:
```matlab
controlPointsX = [0 2 4 5 7 9 10];
controlPointsY = [1 6 8 2 8 7 4];
degree = 3;
